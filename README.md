## Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the last LTS version.

## General Installation instructions

The best option to start with this project is cloning it in your PC:

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/NextJSCrudAndApi.git
```

Now you should update your .env file with your own database and IP data. An example is showed:

```
JWT_SECRET = ANY_SECRET

DB_NAME = "db_bicycles_nextjs"
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_USER = "root"
DB_PASS = "sasa"

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = "http://192.168.0.104:3000/api/bicycles"
```

Don't forget to create the database with the name entered in your .env file. In former example the database would be "db_bicycles_nextjs".

Now it's time to install all dependencies.

```
cd NextJSCrudAndApi
npm install
```

Now you can start the project in your dev environment:

```
npm run dev
```

If you follow the former instructions this project will be running on the following url: http://localhost:3000

Enjoy!!!
